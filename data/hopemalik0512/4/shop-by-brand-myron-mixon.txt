Myron Mixon
We call them “sear stations” for a reason; GrillGrates turn pellet smokers into pellet grills. They trap and concentrate heat and conduct it up the rails for great searing while the valleys sizzle juices for added flavor. GrillGrates typically add 100 degrees or more at the grate surface on pellet grills. *GrillGrate is not affiliated with Myron Mixon Smokers.
